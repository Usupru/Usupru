## 👋 Hey there!

Since I was a kid, I dreamt of building new machines, featuring flashy lights and advanced technology. Today, I'm trying to fulfill that dream by getting into engineering.

If an idea pops into my head, I’ll build it. If I don’t know how, I’ll learn.

My main languages are Python, C++ and C, although I often end up using web interfaces for my projects.

I also learned many things about cybersecurity along my tech journey, and Im looking forward to complete the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/en-em/certifications/security/">CompTIA Security +</a> certification in the following months.

If you wish to contact me, feel free to visit my Linkedln along futher information.
